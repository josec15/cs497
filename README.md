## Question #1
I used a double for loop  
the first for loop will start from the first index  
the second for loop will start from +1 of the index in the first loop  
those two indexes will be compared to see if they are equal to the target value  
if so, return the indexes, if not, loop again
Complexity = O(n^2), not the most efficient
