## Question #1
I used a double for loop  
the first for loop will start from the first index  
the second for loop will start from +1 of the index in the first loop  
those two indexes will be compared to see if they are equal to the target value  
if so, print the indexes, if not, loop again.  
Complexity = O(n^2), not very efficient

## Question #2
I used the bisect module in python to locate  
specific points in the sorted list. If the target point is found it is  
stored in the left and right variable, depending on how frequently it appears in the list.  
If the target value is not found in the list then we print the exception. If found,  
print the first index and last index of the array.  
Complexity = O(logn), very efficient

## Question #3


## Question #4
Was not able to get a running program.  
Create a linked list and use two pointers to traverse the linked list  
and locate the nth position. The node at the nth position would be removed  
and would print the modified head.  
Complexity = O(n), not very efficient

## Question #5
Unable to get a running program.  
Wrote suedo code that traveses through the lists and adds each node  
to a new linked list which will then be sorted by built in python function  
and displayed.  
Complexity = unsure
